      <p>University of Nebraska-Lincoln Chancellor Harvey Perlman has stepped back from his enrollment goal of 30,000 students by 2017. Instead, Perlman thinks 2020 is more reasonable.</p>
<p>Since 2011, when Perlman originally set his goal, enrollment has actually dropped by 148 students. And despite a large freshman class this year, total enrollment only grew by 240 students. To reach the new 2020 goal, enrollment would have to increase by over 900 students each year.</p>
<p>“The goal seemed ambitious. It's always seemed ambitious to me from the day I announced it,” Perlman said. “I think it's energized the campus. But I don't think we ought to kill ourselves to reach it.”</p>	
<p>It is an ambitious goal, especially considering that UNL has only had more than 25,000 students once, in 1982. But it seems that unattainable goals are becoming all too common at our university, because according to Mark Miller, director of facilities planning and construction, the final phase of renovations for the student union should have been completed in "late-December to January." </p>

<h2>Out-of-state enrollment increases</h2>

<div id="residentText">
      <p>One way the university has tried to boost enrollment is with out-of-state recruiting. Alan Cerveny, dean of Enrollment Management at UNL said, “The admissions office aggressively recruits prospective students regardless of where they reside,” Cerveny said. “That said, we focus on our neighboring states and states in our new Big Ten footprint." UNL has full-time recruiters in Chicago, Minneapolis and Denver to boost these out-of-state numbers. The university also focuses on Kansas City Metro area, Sioux Falls, S.D., and Milwaukee.</p>
